# Heckmeck/Pickomino

This repository contains a framework to support policy learning for the tabletop game Heckmeck (also known as Pickomino). The purpose of this framework is to allow students to implement algorithms for learning AI players for the game and evaluate the performance of these players against human/other AI players. 

Students making use of the framework will need to create a Player subclass for their AI player that selects moves on the basis of a learned policy, and write code to learn their policy on the basis of repeated simulations of the game.
